 * The program currently only calculates for the chest piece taking
 * information from only one armor set
 */

/** TODO
 * Add the other armor sets and create a way for the player to see the value
 * of each set by choice before deciding the level
 *
 * Allow the armor sets to be applied to head variants then leg variants and calculate
 * the total defense
 *
 * Allow the player to go without armor
